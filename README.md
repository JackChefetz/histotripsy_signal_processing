Code for calculating histotripsy signal bubble dissolution time is kept here. 

Contents:
- `speedy_processing.m` is our MATLAB script which calculates bubble dissolution time.
- `setup.m` files are various setup files run on the Verasonics system in lab.
- `speedy_power_fit.cpp` is a C++ file called as a `mex` function in `speedy_processing.m`.
- Fall and Winter data files include previous offline simulations and necessary data files.
